# WixMoviesApp
Made By: Orel Chertkow  

An app created from scratch as a qualification project for a Wix react native position - **Successfully Passed**.

I also added additional depth and features in addition to the base requirements:
1. A user can log in to his TMDB account on the app.
2. A user can manage his TMDB account's watch list through the app.

The app, using TMDB's API, lets the user log in to his TMDB account and see a list of popular movies in his country and manage his accountâ€™s watch list.

The app was tested on my mobile android phone (Samsung Galaxy S9+) as well as on an iPhone 14 Pro Max ios simulator using Xcode.

## Requirements: 
1. You need to have Node.js installed.

## Instructions to run:
1. Download the code from the repository as a ZIP.
2. Extract the project's folder from the ZIP.
3. Open the terminal on the project's directory.
4. Run `npm install` to install all of the required dependencies.
5. Run `npx expo start` to start the expo development server.
6. You can run the app on your phone or a simulator:
   * Mobile Phone - Download and open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code shown in the terminal.
   * ios simulator - Start the simulator and press `i` in the terminal to open the app - the simulator will open expo and run the app.
   * android emulator - Start the emulator and press `a` in the terminal to open the app - the emulator will open expo and run the app.
